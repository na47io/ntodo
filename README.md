# ntodo

__n__ested **todo** list ðŸ˜„

features:

- unlimited nesting
- parent items cannot be closed before all the child items are closed

that's it

## quirks

- multiline tasks not allowed. if you need multiple lines you're either waffling or not being granular enough. probably both!

## ideas

1. vim bindings (plsssssss santa)
2. PREACT AND SIGNALS MAYBE??? hooks are one-way? i think. and thats a problem for adding multiple tasks.

## bad ideas

- make all parent items a `<details>` - too hard also looks crap
